You need two dependencies to compile this project. (right now)

https://github.com/meebey/SmartIrc4net

Clone this project, open it in visual studio, build it for release and dump "Meebey.SmartIrc4net.dll" and "StarkSoftProxy.dll" in here.

In the IRC-Sharp project, it might find the DLLs automagically. If not, point references to them (you'll probably have to browse for them)
