You need one dependency to compile this project. (right now)

https://github.com/meebey/SmartIrc4net

Clone this project, open it in visual studio, build it for release and dump the "Meebey.SmartIrc4net.dll" DLL in here. NOTE: You don't need the starksoftproxy.dll.

In the IRC-Sharp project, it might find the DLL automagically. If not, point a reference to it (you'll probably have to browse for it)
